# Kayaking

Float along this beautiful stretch of river in Provo Canyon on a top-of-the-line Aire inflatable kayak. We offer both single and tandem options. With small seats and self-bailing bottoms, these “duckies” are comfortable and easy to maneuver. We offer seven river shuttles on the hour starting at 10am – Monday thru Saturday. Some Paddling experience recommended. Swimmers in good physical shape and self-rescue abilities are essential. Please choose Guided Utah Kayaking or Guided Utah Rafting from our menu if you are completely new to paddling, not a strong swimmer or have some physical conditions that would prevent proper self-rescue.

If you choose the guided option, our friendly staff will show you the basics of how to paddle your own kayak as you follow them down the Provo River. Beautiful scenery and fun splashes make this 6-mile trip enjoyable all summer long.
