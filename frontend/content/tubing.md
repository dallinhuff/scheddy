# Provo River Tubing

Have a blast tubing down the Provo River on our custom-made, heavy-duty river tubes.

Single Tube (ages 12+) and Double Tubes (8+ with adult) are available most days starting at 10am with shuttles leaving our private parking area on the river every hour till 4pm and every 30 minutes on weekends in July and August. The typical float time is 90 – 120 minutes depending on the seasonal flows.

College age and Young Adults that are strong swimmers tend to enjoy tubing more than other age groups. Rafting is better option for weak swimmers and older and younger participants.

Be Safe and courteous on the river – Keep our beautiful rivers clean by packing everything out you pack in.

Please no excessive drinking and remember alcohol and cold water can be a dangerous combination.
